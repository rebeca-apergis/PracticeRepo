This is going to be a list of the commands I'm learning in GIT!

git init = initializes git inside a new folder
ls -a = lists all files, including invisible ones.
git status = check status of your repository
git add . = stages all files in folder
git add NAMEXAMPLE.type = stage only a specific file
git commit -m "message" -m "description" = commits the changes as long as you provide the strings.
git log = shows history of commits and their messages
touch name.type = adds a file of a certain type to the repository.
git checkout -b branchname = creates a new branch
git branch = lists all the branches
git checkout <commit-hash> = pulls your files to the state of the selected commit
git merge = merges changes from other branches into your main.
git remote add origin URL = sets a new remote repository for you to push things to.
git remote -v = checks out the new remote url.
git push origin master = pushes the changes from master to your repo on github.
git clone URL = downloads a whole remote directory to your computer.
cd Foldername = moves you forward into the folder of choice.
cd C:\Users\Rebeca\ETC = moves you backwards into the named folder of choice.
eval `ssh-agent -s` = kicks off SSH agent.
